# Wrath of the Vanilla
This is a collection of my work towards turning a server running [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) into a server limited to the original content.

I never liked the limitations of the vanilla client, and the mechanics of the game weren't exactly my favorite. This helps me getting around those issues, running Wrath of the Lich King mechanics with classic content.

I removed certain talents from the trees to make them look like the original layouts but those changes require changes to both the server and the client files. I will not be sharing those changes here for legal reasons.

I'm working my way through one zone at a time, it will take a very long time to finish the entire world and I will work on it when I have the time to.

If I missed something in a zone, or something turns out to be wrong after my changes, I will be fixing it if I'm told about it.

The loot tables are not being worked on until I've gotten quite a bit of the map done. Dungeons and raids are also on hold until I have done a larger amount of zones. The same goes for spawn points of creatures and objects.

# Important information
Do **not** import spell_proc_event.sql. It's there to prevent errors caused by my changes to the talent trees.

# Credit
A lot of credit goes to the wonderful people working on [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) and [vMaNGOS](https://github.com/vmangos).
