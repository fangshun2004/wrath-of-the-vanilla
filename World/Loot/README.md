# Information
These are reworked loot tables for dungeons, raids, Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms.

Running merge.bat, on Windows, generates a single file with all loot tables and references. There is currently no script for Linux but can easily be created if the demand is there.

The loot tables are taken from [vMaNGOS](https://github.com/vmangos) and modified for [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk).
